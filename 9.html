<div class="p2"><p>Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an original formulation of a
 computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding,
 generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and 
 implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in one
 or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific 
 task or solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge
 of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic</br></p>
<h2>Methodologies</h2>
<p>
The first step in most formal software development processes is requirements analysis, followed by testing to determine value modeling,
 implementation, and failure elimination (debugging). There exist a lot of differing approaches for each of those tasks. One approach 
 popular for requirements analysis is Use Case analysis. Many programmers use forms of Agile software development where the various stages
 of formal software development are more integrated together into short cycles that take a few weeks rather than years. There are many
 approaches to the Software development process.Popular modeling techniques include Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)
 and Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a notation used for both the OOAD and MDA.
A similar technique used for database design is Entity-Relationship Modeling (ER Modeling).
Implementation techniques include imperative languages (object-oriented or procedural), functional languages, and logic languages.</p>
