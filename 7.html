<div class="n1"><h1>VLSI systems</h1><p></p><img src="n2.jpg" width="80%" height="60%"></a></div>
<div class="n2"><p>Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) is the process of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining thousands of transistors 
into a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when complex semiconductor and communication technologies were being developed. The
 microprocessor is a VLSI device. Before the introduction of VLSI technology most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform.
 An electronic circuit might consist of a CPU, ROM, RAM and other glue logic. VLSI lets IC designers add all of these into one chip.</p>
</br><h4>Developments</h4></br>
<p>The first semiconductor chips held two transistors each. Subsequent advances added more transistors, and as a consequence, more
 individual functions or systems were integrated over time. The first integrated circuits held only a few devices, perhaps as many as 
 ten diodes, transistors, resistors and capacitors, making it possible to fabricate one or more logic gates on a single device. Now known 
 retrospectively as small-scale integration (SSI), improvements in technique led to devices with hundreds of logic gates, known as
 medium-scale integration (MSI). Further improvements led to large-scale integration (LSI), i.e. systems with at least a thousand logic
 gates. Current technology has moved far past this mark and today's microprocessors have many millions of gates and billions of individual
 transistors.At one time, there was an effort to name and calibrate various levels of large-scale integration above VLSI.</br></br> Terms like
 ultra-large-scale integration (ULSI) were used. But the huge number of gates and transistors available on common devices has rendered 
 such fine distinctions moot. Terms suggesting greater than VLSI levels of integration are no longer in widespread use.
In 2008, billion-transistor processors became commercially available. This became more commonplace as semiconductor fabrication advanced
 from the then-current generation of 65 nm processes. Current designs, unlike the earliest devices, use extensive design automation and 
 automated logic synthesis to lay out the transistors, enabling higher levels of complexity in the resulting logic functionality. Certain
 high-performance logic blocks like the SRAM (static random-access memory) cell, are still designed by hand to ensure the highest efficiency.</p>

 <h2>Structured Design</h2></br>
 <p>Structured VLSI design is a modular methodology originated by Carver Mead and Lynn Conway for saving microchip area by minimizing 
 the interconnect fabrics area. This is obtained by repetitive arrangement of rectangular macro blocks which can be interconnected using 
 wiring by abutment. An example is partitioning the layout of an adder into a row of equal bit slices cells. In complex designs this
 structuring may be achieved by hierarchical nesting.Structured VLSI design had been popular in the early 1980s, but lost its popularity
 later because of the advent of placement and routing tools wasting a lot of area by routing, which is tolerated because of the progress
 of Moore's Law. When introducing the hardware description language KARL in the mid' 1970s, Reiner Hartenstein coined the term 
 "structured VLSI design" (originally as "structured LSI design"), echoing Edsger Dijkstra's structured programming approach by procedure
 nesting to avoid chaotic spaghetti-structured program</p>
