<div class="q2"><p>Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. As a 
subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing. It allows
 a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and signal 
 distortion during processing. Since images are defined over two dimensions (perhaps more) digital image processing may be modeled
 in the form of multidimensional systems.</br></p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Many of the techniques of digital image processing, or digital picture processing as it often was called, were developed in the 1960s 
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Laboratories, University of Maryland, and a few other
 research facilities, with application to satellite imagery, wire-photo standards conversion, medical imaging, videophone, character 
 recognition, and photograph enhancement.The cost of processing was fairly high, however, with the computing equipment of that era.
 That changed in the 1970s, when digital image processing proliferated as cheaper computers and dedicated hardware became available. 
 Images then could be processed in real time, for some dedicated problems such as television standards conversion. As general-purpose 
 computers became faster, they started to take over the role of dedicated hardware for all but the most specialized and computer-intensive
 operations. With the fast computers and signal processors available in the 2000s, digital image processing has become the most common form 
 of image processing and generally, is used because it is not only the most versatile method, but also the cheapest.
Digital image processing technology for medical applications was inducted into the Space Foundation Space Technology Hall of Fame in 1994.
In 2002 Raanan Fattel, introduced Gradient domain image processing, a new way to process images in which the differences between pixels are 
manipulated rather than the pixel values themselves.</p>
